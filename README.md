EvaNN: this tool gives an energy estimation of DNN architecture.

First, need to put Cacti into the folder ./

The use of the tool is just executing main.py.

The parameters are seperated in two files - hardware.cfg and network.cfg.

In network.cfg, one could specify the type of layer, and the layer associated parameters.

In hardware.cfg, one could specify the hardware related parameters.
